## Zoo Management System - Java Project
# Overview
This project simulates a zoo with various animals using Java's object-oriented programming concepts. It involves creating a base Animal class, extending it for specific animals like Tiger and Dolphin, and implementing behavior through interfaces. The system also includes an interactive menu for testing and interacting with the animals.

# Features
Animal Class: A base class for common animal properties and behaviors.
Tiger & Dolphin Classes: Subclasses representing land and water animals.
Penguin Class: A special class that implements both walking and swimming behaviors.
# Interfaces:
Eat: Common eating behavior for all animals.
Walk: For land animals.
Swim: For water animals.
Interactive Menu: Allows the user to interact with the zoo, perform actions like feeding, walking, and swimming.
# Technologies Used
Java (Object-Oriented Programming)
Interfaces for behavior modeling
# Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the files.
Ensure you have Java (JDK 8 or higher) installed.
Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
Run the Main.java class to start the interactive menu.
# How to Use
Use the menu to create animals and perform actions.
Animals can eat, walk, or swim based on their type (e.g., Tiger walks, Dolphin swims).
The Penguin can both walk and swim.
